# Brazil-Pesticide-Smuggling-Analysis
## About Dataset
This dataset has information extracted from forensic reports of confiscated pesticides. These reports were prepared by Brazil's Federal Police between 2008 and 2018. The dataset has information about dates, places and volumes of confiscation, as well as characteristics of confiscated products. It demonstrates that the market of smuggled pesticides is probably small, there is no evidence that smuggled pesticides are substantially more toxic than legally-traded ones (although they may be of greater environmental risk), smuggled pesticides are rarely counterfeit, and organized groups may be involved with this crime, but petty smugglers prevail.
